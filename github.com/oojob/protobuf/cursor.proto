 * Pagination help's us to paginate large set of data through curser based

 * mentioned on previous.
 * cursors in pagination
 * Cursors are pointers to the spot where we’ve left off in the data. More
 * specifically, cursors are variables that can hold any value that the
 client
 * can pass to the server to help the it find the point at which it should
 start
 * returning data. It doesn’t matter what value you use, and in fact it
 should
 * be opaque from the point of view of the client.
